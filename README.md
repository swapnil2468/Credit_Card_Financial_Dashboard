## ðŸ“Š DAX Queries Used

### Categorizing Customers by Age
Categorizes customers into age groups for segmentation analysis.
```DAX
AgeGroup = SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 30, "20-30",
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 30 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 40, "30-40", 
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 40 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 50, "40-50", 
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 50 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 60, "50-60", 
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 60, "60+",
    "Unknown"
)
```

### Categorizing Customers by Income
Classifies customers into income groups to assess spending patterns.
```DAX
IncomeGroup = SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    'public cust_detail'[income] < 35000, "Low",
    'public cust_detail'[income] >= 35000 && 'public cust_detail'[income] < 70000, "Med", 
    'public cust_detail'[income] >= 70000, "High",
    "Unknown"
)
```

### Extracting the Week Number from Date
Extracts the week number from the `week_start_date` field for trend analysis.
```DAX
week_num2 = WEEKNUM('public cc_detail'[week_start_date])
```

### Calculating Total Revenue
Calculates total revenue by summing up annual fees, transaction amounts, and interest earned.
```DAX
Revenue = 'public cc_detail'[annual_fees] + 'public cc_detail'[total_trans_amt] + 'public cc_detail'[interest_earned]
```

### Computing Revenue for the Current Week
Computes the revenue for the most recent week using a filter on the maximum `week_num2`.
```DAX
Current_week_Revenue = CALCULATE( 
    SUM('public cc_detail'[Revenue]), 
    FILTER(
        ALL('public cc_detail'),
        'public cc_detail'[week_num2] = MAX('public cc_detail'[week_num2])
    )
)
```

### Computing Revenue for the Previous Week
Calculates revenue for the previous week for comparison and performance tracking.
```DAX
Previous_week_Revenue = CALCULATE( 
    SUM('public cc_detail'[Revenue]), 
    FILTER(
        ALL('public cc_detail'),
        'public cc_detail'[week_num2] = MAX('public cc_detail'[week_num2]) - 1
    )
)
```
